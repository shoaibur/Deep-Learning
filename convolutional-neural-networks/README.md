# Convolutional Neural Networks
Outline
* Introduction
  * MLP vs. CNN
    * MLPs convert images into vectors, so spatial information is lost, while CNNs preserve the spatial information.
    * MLPs use only fully connected layers and accept only vectors as the inputs, while CNNs use sparsely connected layers and accept matrix data as the inputs.
  * Why do CNNs works?
  * Application of CNNs
